# automated-ielts-marker

## About the Project
A program which can mark the task 2 writing of the IELTS written test automatically. Many students studying for the IELTS examination have difficulty receiving proper feedback and marks on their writing practice. This program looks to remedy that and allows you to upload your work in either a docx or txt format and receive a mark back, along with some feedback. The program was originally written in Python in 2024 to practice my Python and was later translated to C++. Either version works well but there are occassionally discrepencies between marks due to the spellcheck dictionaries slightly differing. 

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
```sh
   git clone https://github.com/cullendales/automated-ielts-marker
```
2. Ensure all .txt files are downloaded for the C++ version.

## Usage
#### Python
1. Run the program using the test IELTS paper included in the python folder or your own docx file.
2. Include the docx file in the command line.
3. Read the feedback offered by the program and make changes to your paper before running it again to see how correcting minor mistakes can improve your mark a ton.

#### C++
1. Run the program using the test IELTS paper included in the cpp folder or your own .txt file - with a space between paragraphs.
2. Ensure all .txt files included in the cpp folder have been downloaded.
3. Run the program and when prompted type the name of your .txt file with the .txt ending.
4. Read the feedback offered by the program and make changes to your paper before running it again to see how correcting minor mistakes can improve your mark a ton.

## Notes

This program received a 95% success rate at matching 20 professionally marked IELTS task 2 papers from 5 different students with marks ranging from 5.5 - 8.5 out of 9. However, the marks given by this program are to give you a general idea of your IELTS score and are not interchangeable with those of a real examiner - especially for marks lower than a 6 or higher than an 8. If your paper is written well but off-topic, this program will overscore it. Enjoy the program but please be aware of possible overscoring. Best of luck on your IELTS examination!
