Some people are of the opinion that the swift development of technology is a major driving force behind social issues. I partially advocate for this assertion as our community has wide-ranging benefits from it along with its drawbacks.

On the one hand, there are several reasons to explain why people believe cutting-age technology has detrimental influences on society. In this day and age, it is a fairly routine for individuals to exposure technology in every single aspects of life such as communication, transportation or working. Due to these constant appearance and mobility, it potentially forms human’s behaviour and mindset. The internet, for instance, is a global network with the proliferation of information, where some people can take advantage of it to spreading false information, gambling, violent behaviors. This tend to poison users, push them closer to involve in societal matters and eventually national cultures would be phrased out.
 
However, thanks to the sate-of-the-art technology, the community receive many merits. Firsr of all, technology  contributes to lift the living standards. To be specific, individuals can facilitate access to the information and healthcare services, boosting their well-being rate. Futhermore, their financial stability also could be enhanced. Technology creates tons of different types of new jobs such as developers, computer workers, graphic designers, combined with home-based jobs, which robust human’s income and national economies. 

In conclusion, I partly agree with the claim that developing rapidly technology is the primary reason for social problems. Apart from negatively effects on humns act and thought, it is a potential tool to improve their living standards.
